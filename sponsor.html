      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS</h2>
      <p>Traditionally, STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics. But for the Ignite STEAM fair we are going to mix it up.</p>
      <p>The STEAM topics that our presentations will focus on are: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arithmetic, and the Medical Field. We plan to have some truly diverse presentations.</p>
      <p>Anyone can attend an Ignite event. The Ignite Frisco STEAM Fair targets children from ages Kindergarten through 12th grade, they are all welcome to listen to high school students and adults talk about STEAM.</p>
