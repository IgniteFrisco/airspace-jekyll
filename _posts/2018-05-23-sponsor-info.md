Below is some basic sponsor information you need to know. We have strong goals in mind, with the ambition of making an impact on the community of Frisco. We value your support in making this event a success!

Please donate any items that you can for the success of the event. For example, if we require food, drinks, additional raffle prizes, or any equipment or materials for event day, providing us with those items will earn you special recognition at our event in front of a large audience, with a chance to book your own advertising space to reach out to parents and students.

**More information will soon be provided on the "Sponsor Us" page, with an updated list of all items needed for the event, as well as the names of sponsors who have agreed to provide each required item.**
