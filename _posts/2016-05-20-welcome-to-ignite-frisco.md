# Hello!
We are very excited to get Ignite Frisco up and running! We plan to host what we are calling the Ignite Frisco STEAM Fair. Of course, you may not understand what that fully means quite yet. So continuing reading to find out!

## What Exactly is Ignite?
Ignite is a program that has existed for a few years around the world. Including [Sydney](http://www.ignitesydney.com/), [Baltimore](http://www.ignitebaltimore.com/), [Phoenix](https://www.ignitephoenix.com/), [Boulder](https://igniteboulder.com/), and many more. The first Ignite took place in Seattle in 2006, and since then the event has become an international phenomenon.

The primary premise on which Ignite is built is to "Enlighten us, but make it quick!" Presenters get 20 slides, which automatically advance every 15 seconds. The result is a fast and fun presentation which lasts just 5 minutes.

Here is a video of Mark Cohen's presentation at Ignite Sydney:
