# Hello!
We are very excited to get Frisco IgniteEdited  up and running! We plan to host the Frisco Ignite STEAM Fair. Of course, you may not understand what that fully means quite yet. So continue reading to find out!

## What Exactly is Ignite?
The Frisco Ignite STEAM Fair is a force for raising the collective IQ and building connections in Frisco among small children and the surrounding communities. Ignite is about celebrating Frisco's growing arts and culture scene & helps to attract and retain the creative minds of children with its inclusive appeal.

Ignite is a program that has existed for a few years around the world. Including [Sydney](http://www.ignitesydney.com/), [Baltimore](http://www.ignitebaltimore.com/), [Phoenix](https://www.ignitephoenix.com/), [Boulder](https://igniteboulder.com/), and many more. The first Ignite took place in Seattle in 2006, and since then the event has become an international phenomenon.

The primary premise on which Ignite is built is to "Enlighten us, but make it quick!" Presenters get 20 slides, which automatically advance every 15 seconds. The result is a fast and fun presentation which lasts just 5 minutes.

Here is a video of Mark Cohen's presentation at Ignite Sydney:

## What's next?
Join us! We are hosting an Ignite event right here in Frisco, free and available to everyone! The event is suitable for K-12 and adults too!

Frisco Ignite is going to be a 2 hours and 45 minutes long conventional event that will be held this upcoming September and will be hosted by high school students from Lone Star and Memorial.
